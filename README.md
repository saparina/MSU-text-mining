# MSU-text-mining
My research project in MSU (Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics, Department of Computing Systems and Automation) includes term paper named *"Research of vector models of representation of the texts based on a set of *word2vec* algorithms "* and code.

**Now available:** notebook with solution **one-class classification** task based on *doc2vec*. 

Research supervisor: Tsarev D.

### Dataset
We used *Enron Corpus* processed by special algorithms developed in Laboratory of Programming Technologies CMC MSU, that's why it's not public.
